3. Click on Generate, enter the following prompt "Generate script that calculates totalprice by looping through each element in $.context.startEvent.items and calculates totalprice by multiplying $.context.startEvent.items.itemPrice and $.context.startEvent.items.quantity and convert to string and assign to $.context.custom.totalprice"<br>
<br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/GenScript.png)

4. System will generate script, check if script is fine, Accept it, Validate Script, Apply and Save Process.<br>

  IF sy-subrc <> 0.
    response->set_status( i_code = 400
                     i_reason = 'Bad request').
