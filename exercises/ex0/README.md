# Purchase Order Approval Process 

In this exercise we will learn how to use Joule for Developers/Generative AI capabilities of SAP Build in Process Automation. We will use following features to create a Purchase Order Approval process:

1. Generate Process Template<br>
2. Generate Form<br>
3. Generate Script<br>
4. Generate Business Rules<br>

Note: Save work with each step just to make sure we do not lose out on any information.

## Process Generation

In this step we will generate Purchase Order Approval process using Generative AI.

1. Click on Generate and select Process<br>
<br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/GenProc.png)

2.Enter following prompt "Generate empty Process for Purchase Requisition" and click on send icon<br>
<br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/GenProcPromt.png)

 System will create a process template and open design editor to continue designing the process<br> 

## Form Generation

In this step we will generate a form using Generative AI and use it as Trigger Form to start the process.

1. Click on "+" button after "Add a Trigger" step. From Smart Menu, select Form.<br>
<br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/Form.png)

2.	Enter the prompt to generate PR Submission Form "Create PR Submission Form with fields Company, Supplier, Delivery Address, Delivery Date, Payment Terms, Requested By and Department and a table with fields Item, Description, Quantity, Item Price".<br>

7.Click on PR Submission Form and Click on Inputs tab. Map all the attributes from Process Inputs<br>
Company, Delivery Address, Delivery Date, Department, Items, Payment Terms, Requested By, Supplier<br>
<br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/MapInput_Variables.png)

   
## Script Generation

In this step we will write a custom script using Generative AI to calculate total price value and assign to custom variable.

1. Click on ‘+’ next to Trigger, select Script Task from smart menu,
<br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/AddScriptTask.png)

2. Click on Open Editor
3. Select the existing script and delete it<br>
<br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/OpenEditor.png)

4. Click on Generate, enter the following prompt <br>
``` script
Generate script that calculates totalprice by looping through each element in $.context.startEvent.items
and calculates totalprice by multiplying $.context.startEvent.items.itemPrice and $.context.startEvent.items.quantity and assign to $.context.custom.totalprice
``` 
<br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/GenScript.png)

4. System will generate script, check if script is fine, Accept it, Validate Script, Apply and Save Process.<br>
<br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/Script.png)

 ## Rules Generation
 
 In this step we will create a business rule using Generative AI to dynamically determine approvers of purchase requisitions.

 1. After script task, click on "+", select Decision from smart menu<br>
 <br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/Decision.png)
   
 2. Click on Blank Decision<br>
 <br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/BlankDec.png) 
   
 3. Give the name as "Determine Approver" and click on Create.<BR>
 <br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/CreateDec.png)

 4. Decision will be opened in a new tab, from right side panel create input parameter "Supplier" (string) , output parameter "Approver" (string) and Save the Process.
 <br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/DeterApp.png)
 
 5. Click on Generate, select Generate Rule, enter the following prompt and Save Process:
"create a decision table rule with name "approver determination" to determine approver based on supplier such that if the supplier is 1710, the purchase requisition must be approved by the "adminmanager@sap.com". If supplier is 1720, it must be approved by "procurementmanager@sap.com"<br>
<b>Note: Replace email ID with valid process automation user email id(your user id shared in the beginning) for testing purpose.<br>
<br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/RulePrompt.png)<br>
<br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/DecisionTable.png)

6. If Decision "Determine Approver is <b>not available<b> in the main process (Purchase Requisition), click on ‘+’ button after Script Task, select Decision from smart menu and select Determine Approver decision which we created in last step and save.<br>
<br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/AvailableDec.png)

7. On the right-hand side panel select Inputs, map Supplier with Supplier from PR Submission Form and Save the process.
